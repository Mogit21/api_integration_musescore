# api_integration_musescore

Requirements:
requests for making API calls.

pandas for processing and saving data to CSV.

You may need to install MuseScore's API if there are specific endpoints you want to use.


Explanation:
Fetch Data from MuseScore API:

The fetch_musescore_data function makes a GET request to the MuseScore API to fetch score data. You need to replace the URL with the actual API endpoint if itâ€™s different from the example provided.

Process Data:

This function converts the fetched JSON data into a pandas DataFrame, selects relevant columns (title, author, genre), and performs a simple cleanup (trimming extra spaces).

Save to CSV:

The cleaned data is then saved to a CSV file for further analysis or use.

Possible Modifications:
API Endpoints: You may need to change the API endpoint URL and parameters depending on the specific data you want to fetch from MuseScore.

Data Structure: Depending on how MuseScore's API responds, you might need to modify the process_musescore_data function to handle the specific structure of the data (such as nested dictionaries or lists).
